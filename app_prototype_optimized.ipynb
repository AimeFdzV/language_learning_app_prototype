        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Language Learning App Prototype! This notebook demonstrates an initial prototype for a language learning application. The app predicts and translates words that a learner might find challenging based on their proficiency level and the words they mark as unknown.\n",

        "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Run All Cells**: To get started, you need to run all the cells in this notebook. This will install the necessary libraries, download required data, and set up the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Interface Deployment**: Once all cells are run, a Gradio interface will be deployed at the bottom of this notebook. You will interact with this interface to use the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using the Interface**:\n",
        "   - **Native Language**: Select your native language (currently only English is available).\n",
        "   - **Target Language**: Select the target language you want to learn (currently only Spanish is available).\n",
        "   - **Proficiency Level**: Choose your proficiency level from A1 to C2.\n",
        "   - **Text Input**: Enter the text you want to read and learn from in the target language.\n",
        "   - **Start**: Click the 'Start' button to begin the process. The app will process the text, predict unknown words, and provide translations.\n",
        "   - **Input Unknown Words**: You can input any additional unknown words you encounter.\n",
        "   - **Next Paragraph**: Click the 'Next Paragraph' button to process the next paragraph of text.\n",
        "   - **Restart**: If you want to start over, click the 'Restart' button to reset the interface.\n"

The `similarity_threshold` determines how similar two words need to be to be considered cognates. This threshold ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value means that the words need to be more similar to be identified as cognates. Setting a high threshold, such as 0.8 or 0.9, makes it stricter, so only very similar words are identified as cognates. This reduces false positives but might miss some valid cognates. Conversely, a lower threshold, such as 0.5 or 0.6, makes it more lenient, allowing more words to be identified as cognates, which can include false positives.\n",

        "## Evaluating the prototype\n",
        "Here are some ideas on how to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions:\n",
        "### 1. Ground Truth Data\n",
        "The first and easiest approach, which can be done without having users to test the app, is to use ground truth data, where we get or create pre-annotated texts with known unknown words for different proficiency levels. We can then compare the app's predictions with these annotations. Data for expected known and unknown words according to the proficiency level can be gathered form CEFR lexical sets. Another good place to look for data is [CL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/search/?q=spanish+unknown+words), a repository of research papers in computational linguistics that often include datasets.\n",
        "#### Precision and Recall:\n",
        "Calculate precision and recall for the predicted unknown words compared to the ground truth annotations. Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified unknown words out of all predicted unknown words, while recall measures the proportion of correctly identified unknown words out of all actual unknown words.\n",
        "#### F1 Score:\n",
        "Compute the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, to provide a single metric for evaluation.\n",
        "### 2. User Feedback\n",
        "When user feedback becomes available, we can ask users to mark which predicted unknown words they actually found challenging and measure the percentage of user agreement with the app's predictions.\n",
        "### 3. Weighted Precision and Recall\n",
        "For a more comprehensive evaluation, we should note that not all errors should be treated with the same importance. The severity of an error in the context of this language learning app can vary based on the type of word and its role in the sentence or text.\n",
        "To reflect the different severities of errors, we can use weighted precision and recall. Here, different types of errors are assigned different weights based on their importance.\n",
        "#### Error Severity\n",
        "Here are some examples of how we can classify the severity of the errors based on their impact on understanding the text:\n",
        "*   **False Positives (Unnecessary Translations)**: Less severe. These are words that the app translates but the user didn't need help with. They might create noise in the interface but they will not affect understanding.\n",
        "*   **False Negatives (Missed Translations)**: More severe. These are words that the app didn't translate but the user needed help with. They can significantly affect understanding.\n",
        "*   **Key Content Words**: Very severe if missed. These include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are crucial for understanding the sentence.\n",
        "*   **Function Words**: Less severe if missed. These include conjunctions, prepositions, articles, etc., that add grammatical structure but less semantic meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importance-Based Weighting\n",

        "### Expanding to different languages\n",
        "To adapt the code for different language pairs we need to consider the a series of modifications. This involves updating language-specific components such as NLP models, translation services, frequency data, and handling morphological differences.\n",
        "1. NLP Models\n",
        "The current code uses Stanza for tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging. Stanza supports many languages, but not all. If we need to support a language that Stanza does not, we may need to switch to another NLP library such as SpaCy, which also supports a wide range of languages.\n",
        "It is important to ensure the new NLP model provides similar functionality (tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, NER). And to consider that the quality of NLP tasks may vary across languages, impacting accuracy.\n",
        "2. Translation Services\n",
        "The code currently uses GoogleTranslator from the deep-translator library. Alternative APIs like DeepL, Yandex, or Microsoft Translator can be considered if a specific language pair is not supported or if a more accurate service is needed for certain languages.\n",
        "Each translation service has different strengths. DeepL is known for high-quality translations but supports fewer languages compared to Google. Costs and API limits also vary.\n",
        "3. Frequency Data\n",
        "The current code uses the wordfreq library for frequency analysis. While it supports many languages, coverage and accuracy might vary. For languages not well-supported by wordfreq, we need to consider alternative frequency data sources or even corpora specific to those languages. Tools like Lexique3 for French or SUBTLEX for various languages can be useful.\n",
        "Frequency data quality is crucial for accurate unknown word prediction, so it is important to ensure that the frequency data is reliable and representative of modern language use.\n",
        "4. Morphological Differences\n",
        "Languages with rich morphology (like Finnish or Turkish) require a more robust morphological analysis. Morfessor or a similar tool can be used for such languages.\n",
        "The current code uses Snowball Stemmer for Spanish. For other languages, stemmers or lemmatizers might vary (for example using the ISRI Stemmer for Arabic).\n",
        "5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
        "The current code uses Stanza for NER, which supports many languages but its performance could vary depending on the language. If NER is not well-supported for a target language, we need to consider alternatives like SpaCy, Polyglot, or even custom-trained models.\n",
        "6. Cognate Identification\n",
        "Finding Cognates in New Language Pairs\n",
        "Technically CogNet has data for several language pairs, however its quality varies from language to language. Wiktionary or BabelNet can be potential sources for multilingual cognate data.\n",
        "7. User Interface Adjustments\n",
        "We will need to update the Gradio interface to ensure that it supports the input and display of characters from various languages, including those with different scripts (like Arabic).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, not all tools support all languages equally. We might need to mix and match different libraries for comprehensive support.\n",
        "These are some possible options for libraries and tools for some of the most used languages as target:\n",
